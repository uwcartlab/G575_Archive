#### By: Stacey Marion, Josh Riebe, Theodore Nguyen

## Final Project Proposal

## Persona/Scenario

**Persona: Wisconsin Prescribed Fire Council Legislative Committee member, policy advocate**

The higher-level goal of the legislative committee is to engage with lawmakers to suggest changes to Wisconsin state legislation regarding prescribed fire activity. Current laws are outdated and do not reflect our new recognition of the need for prescribed fire for ecological good, i.e., climate resiliency. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) traditionally opposes changes to current legislation because the proposed legislations are perceived to undermine WDNR authority and create risks for wildfire. However, the Wisconsin Prescribed Fire Council believes that current state laws are not supported by data. Given limited available data within the state, we believe that **comparing** Wisconsin’s fire laws to those of other states will express clearly that Wisconsin is slow to adopt progressive fire policies, which provide barriers to implementing prescribed fire to the level recommended for the resiliency of our natural plant communities. Other states with more progressive laws accomplish much more burning, even states with extremely high wildfire risk such as Florida. Our objective is to **compare**, **filter**, and **rank** Wisconsin’s fire-related laws to those of other states and compare outcomes, i.e., prescribed fire accomplished. While this domain of information is already available, an interactive map provides a quick and simple mechanism of obtaining the information, while also providing enough information to allow new investigative **insights**.

**Scenario:**

A Fire Council member has requested an audience with a State Representative and wants to brush up on her knowledge of discrepancies in state burn legislation, liability, and certification programs. As she opens the interactive map, the overview shows the entire US map (choropleth) with report card grades and annual acreage burned (proportional symbol). With her primary objective to refresh her memory of Wisconsin’s burn-related laws, she clicks on the state of Wisconsin to **retrieve** state-specific attributes. She recalls that within the retrieval panel/pop-up, there are links to supplemental information about each current law and the Fire Council’s proposed changes. She clicks on the link to open a new browser where she quickly refreshes her memory. After accomplishing her initial info-seeking task, she then settles down to explore some of the attributes she is less familiar with, hoping to gain novel **insight** that she can share for her upcoming meeting with Representative Youngton. She is curious about the establishment of certified burn programs. She navigates to the “State-certified burn program” layer **menu** item and clicks the down arrow to expand an accordion **menu** revealing several year ranges: “Within last 1 year”, “Established 2-5 years ago”, “Established 5-10 years ago”, and “Established > 10 years ago”. She clicks each layer checkbox to reveal all 4 layers, categorized by different colors. She **identifies** some **patterns** such as the South establishing burn programs much earlier than the West Coast or Midwest. Interestingly, Minnesota, Illinois, and Michigan all established certified burn programs within the last 5 years. She clicks on Illinois to **retrieve** additional information and follow a link in the Illinois pop-up to the Illinois Prescribed Fire Council webpage on the state’s new burn certification program.

### Final Proposal
1. Main Objective
    1. Visualize disparities among US states with respect to prescribed fire-related laws, permitting systems, insurance liabilty, and certification programs. 
    2. Create insights about the sails and barriers to effective application of prescribed fire.
    3. Use data to inform discussion about proposed legislative changes in Wisconsin. Use data to support proposed changes.
2. Requirements Document
3. Wireframes
    1. TBD

### **Description:**
This interactive choropleth and proportional symbol map, built using D3 and JQuery, will investigate State disparities in prescribed fire outcomes (acreage burned, etc) as relates to State law, permitting, and certification programs. Prior static maps exist for data circa 2018, however, these maps are difficult to access within a PDF report and do not allow a reader to make comprehensive insights about patterns of prescribed fire implementation related to multiple State-specific legislature and administrative factors.
