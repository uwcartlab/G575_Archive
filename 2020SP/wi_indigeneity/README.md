## Personas
#### Name & Position: Ima Mapper, undergraduate student at University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison
Background  Description: Ima is a freshman at UW-Madison. She hasn't decided on  a major, but is taking a few courses that interest her. As part of a class project, she is learning about museums and decided she would like to know more about where artifacts come from and how they can be returned to Native American tribes. She doesn't know much about repatriation or laws regarding the return of artifacts or human remains including the Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act, and she knows very little about effigy mounds in the Midwest. She would like to be able to IDENTIFY museums that have returned remains as well as COMPARE repatriation numbers between states, museums, and tribes. She would like to specifically see the TRENDS or PATTERNS in repatriation occur within Wisconsin, both in where remains come from, associated funerary objects, and types of institutions that are repatriating artifacts. Her GOAL is to learn about laws such as NAGPRA and become more aware about the importance of repatriation. She desires a site that has organized the data so she can explore without having to be an expert, and has provided plenty of background information to ensure that she can understand the data she sees.

## Scenarios
### Scenario 1
The reader enters the website and sees the title and a brief introduction about what repatriation is. Directly below that is a choropleth map of the United States showing repatriation cases by state. The user can compare number of cases across the country. The user is prompted to scroll down and reads about the Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), as well as other museum repatriation laws and their significance. By continuing to scroll down the page, the user reaches another map centered on Wisconsin. This is a dot density map displaying effigy mounds by county, with a panel alongside that details laws specific to mounds in Wisconsin. Pan and zoom are available but constrained. The user identifies the significance of specific mounds to different indigenous groups and the means or time of their destruction. The next chapter the user reaches focuses on where remains and objects came from and where they were returned to. Institutions are identifiable as well as reservations. By hovering over an institution or First Nation, the name will appear in a popup for identification. In this scenario, the user hovers over several institutions in Milwaukee. By selecting an institution, reservations that had items returned from that institution are connected by arrows. The user selects by clicking the Milwaukee Public Museum, and now sees arrows that visually connect the institution to the Ho-Chunk Nation and Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, as well as several others. An information box below the map populates with information about specific cases, providing more information about remains and items for the user to read. Selecting a reservation will create flow arrows from institutions to the selected reservation, populate the information box, and delineate the traditional lands of the tribe as data allows. Below this on the page is a short paragraph to direct the user further if they would like to learn more about specific tribes or visit the National Park Service NAGPRA page. The user will leave the interactive when their desire to explore for insights on mound destruction and museum repatriations is filled.
