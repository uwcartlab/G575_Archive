        <p>Participatory zoning processes like the one we re-enacted are underway in many protected areas in the tropics where biodiversity overlaps with poverty
             and management institutions are weak and underfunded. Ideally, participatory zoning balances ecosystem conservation and economic development goals
             across large areas and among diverse stakeholders. Community mapping can bolster traditional resource use claims. Zoning can also highlight areas
             of special importance for protecting water and wildlife.</p>

        <p>So, in sum, why go through all the effort to engage stakeholders and do participatory zoning?<p>
            <ul>
                <li>To balance conservation and development goals at the landscape scale.</li>
                <li>To bring competing interest groups together to negotiate rules and create a shared sense of landscape.</li>
                <li>To encourage stakeholder buy-in and avoid costly top-down enforcement.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>What happened in Tambopata in real life?</h2>
            <p>Participatory zoning has been underway in one form or another in Tambopata for nearly two decades.
                Other efforts have focused on agricultural development or mining outside protected areas. 
                Our re-enactment matches a biodiversity-focused effort launched in 2001 funded by the Macarthur Foundation and led by Peruvian conservationists. 
                In reality, more than a dozen zoning maps were proposed by various
                stakeholder groups over the course of years. We selected and simplified four of these proposed maps to use in this exercise.</p>

        <p>Given that this exercise was funded and led by conservationists, ‘forest friendly’ groups were privileged from the start, namely Brazil nut harvesters,
            ecotourism operators, ecologists, the Federation of Indigenous peoples (FENAMAD), and the Agrarian Federation (FADEMAD). However, FADEMAD
            was relatively large and powerful, and its members included some miners and loggers. Thus, after several roundtables and
            debates, participants chose Proposal #2, a simplified version of the map originally proposed by FADEMAD.</p><p>Proposal #2 was thought to best balance
            competing interests. Notably, in place of the Buffer Zone, the participants recommended a new zoning category (a ‘Community Reserve’) that allowed
            all kinds of activities, but only if they were conducted by Tambopata residents. Miners were allocated the gold-rich riverbanks along the Malinowski
            in the NW section of the Reserve.</p>

        <p>This consensus map was sent for approval to Peru’s Institute of Natural Resources (INRENA) in Lima, where it sat for a year under consideration.
            When INRENA finally sent the formally approved zoning map back to Tambopata, stakeholders were met with a surprise: INRENA designated a Buffer Zone,
            arguing that ‘Community Reserve’ was not a legally recognized land use zone (see Official Map below).</p><p>INRENA also erased the direct use zone along the Malinowski River meant
            for mining, hoping this would protect the source of water for the growing city of Puerto Maldonado from mercury contamination.</p>

        <p>Local reaction to the final, INRENA-approved map was mixed. Some <b>Ese’eja</b> citizens were pleased to see ecotourism granted big areas; other Ese’eja opposed
            this. <b>Brazil nut harvesters</b> were encouraged by the formal public support of their activity. The zoning exercise made them feel more confident in
            their rights to exclude loggers and farmers from the old-growth forest where they harvest Brazil nuts, but they admit hunting is not controlled.</p><p>
            Most participants believed <b>mining</b> on the Malinowski would not stop even if it was forbidden on the zoning map. Similarly, many felt the Buffer Zone
            was only a designation on paper, not one that would be enforced in reality.</p>
        
        <p>In 2010, the Peruvian government created a ~5000 km<sup>2</sup> <b>mining corridor</b> through an emergency decree to establish a legally designated area for
            mining to take place if miners obtain environmental and operational permits(to view the mining corridor, select the "turn on/off" checkbox on the
        Official Map below). The mining corridor became permanent in 2012. However, mining continues to occur outside of this legally designated space.</p>

        <h2>Questions to reflect on:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Do you think your character would approve of the final zoning map?</li>
                <li>Would s/h/ze describe the process as truly ‘participatory’?</li>
                <li>Stepping out of character, do you think Peruvian conservationists leading this exercise made the right choice to limit the voice of mining, industrial agriculture,
                    and logging in the zoning process for the Reserve?</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>The mixed results of Participatory Zoning at Tambopata</h2>
        <h3><i>Did the participatory zoning exercise succeed at balancing conservation & development at the landscape scale?</i></h3>

            <p><b><i>Failures: </i></b>Despite the zoning effort, some illegal logging continued in the NE corner of the Tambopata National Reserve (TNR) and
                neighboring indigenous territories. Worse, as expected, illegal gold mining activities exploded in the Buffer Zone and along the upper Malinowski
                River. In 2018 alone, mining destroyed over 9,000 hectares of forests (that’s about 18,000 football fields).</p>

            <p>Here you can see the rapid explansion in two areas of the Buffer Zone:</p>

            <p>Some groups hope that former alluvial mining sites can be reforested. But restoring these highly contaminated, sandy soils is difficult,
                and the planted trees that survive grow slowly. <a href="https://cincia.wfu.edu/en/" target="_blank">CINCIA</a>, a non-profit working to restore Peru’s Amazonian landscape, is piloting remediation
                techniques involving biocarbon to improve tree growth and survivorship in the post-mining site pictured below. Tree growth is slow given
                the severely degraded soils.</p>

            <p><b><i>Successes: </i></b>Forests in the TNR are still fairly well protected. There is negligible mining in the Reserve (despite the presence of
                gold deposits). Instead, more forest-friendly activities predominate, such as Brazil nut harvesting and tourism. </p>

            <p>A few Brazil nut harvesters have also embarked on small commercial ventures that offer tourists a chance to harvest Brazil nuts and stay in rustic
                cabins. Excelsa, pictured below, is one such site. Here a Brazil nut harvester allowed forest to grow back on his pastures, hoping this will
                attract tourists. </p>

            <p>A broader conservation achievement is the fact that the adjacent one million-hectare Bahuaja-Sonene National Park is still mostly protected
                (partly because it is so remote). However, unlike Tambopata, most participatory zoning in the tropics happens where there is no huge,
                intact national park next door. The social and ecological stakes of participatory zoning are higher when there is no other forested area
                left for conservation or sustainable use.</p>

        <h3><i>Did the participatory zoning exercise succeed at bringing competing groups together to negotiate rules and creating a shared sense of landscape?
            Did it avoid conflicts & costly, top-down enforcement?</i></h3>

            <p><b><i>Failures: </i></b>Conservation continues to be a politically charged issue at Tambopata. On one hand, the mayor of the region’s capital,
                Puerto Maldonado, declared the city the ‘Biodiversity Capital of Peru”. But some defiant leaders of loggers and miners have been elected to
                public office by running their campaigns on anti-conservation messages. 
                Attempts to control the explosion of illegal gold mining have involved expensive, militarized interventions (see next).</p>

            <p><b><i>Successes: </i></b>Although participatory zoning didn’t ‘win over’ all residents to a conservation mindset, it raised public awareness.
                Prior to the exercise, most residents knew little about the TNR, whereas after, many understood TNR’s conservation significance. In particular,
                locals had a better awareness of Brazil nut and tourism concessions, the location of the Buffer Zone, etc.</p><p>Most notably, this activity helped
                to strengthen a new Local Management Committee made up of zoning exercise participants and led by the former Agrarian Federation (FADEMAD) leader.
                Together they have achieved remarkable impact, e.g. working with the press and civic organizations to alert the public to mercury pollution,
                creating an anonymous ‘hotline’ to report mining infractions, and blowing the whistle on corruption in the mining sector.</p><p>Confronting
                mining is very risky given the enormous profits and criminality of many operations. Management Committee leaders regularly receive death threats.
                This committee is also working with government agencies to improve the mining formalization process. So effective is this committee that the
                Peruvian government had them coach management committees around other protected areas. The government is even considering expanding the Buffer
                Zone at Tambopata, assuming the Local Management Committee can extend its good work (a tall ask given that they are already stretched thin).

            <p>In February 2019, Peru’s government launched ‘Operation Mercury,’ a multisector governmental operation to confront the illegal mining crisis
                in this region. This crackdown significantly slowed gold mining deforestation in the Buffer Zone and kept it from penetrating the TNR and the
                Bahuaja-Sonene National Park.</p>

        <h3><i>Did the participatory zoning exercise improve local leadership & technical planning skills?</i></h3>

            <p><b><i>Success! </i></b>Stakeholders’ involvement in the exercise allowed them to build new institutions to support decision making. 
                Many participants became members of the Local Management Committee that now oversees the Buffer Zone.</p>

        <h3><i>Did the participatory zoning exercise protect areas of special ecological importance?</i></h3>

            <p><b><i>Mixed Results: </i></b>The Malinowski River, an important headwater, was severely damaged by mining despite zoning protection. Most
                forest is protected in the TNR and the Bahuaja-Sonene Park.</p>

        <h2>Challenges & Uncertainties of Participatory Zoning efforts</h2>
            <p><b><i>HIGHLY POLITICAL?</i></b><br>Yes, very! Zoning is not just about <b><u>where</u></b> resources will be used, but <b><u>who</u></b> gets access.</p>

            <p><b><i>SLOW?</i></b><br>Yes, this was a >5-year process. The government then spent more than a year after the roundtable formalizing and adjusting
                the map chosen at the roundtable. Zoning is still adjusted every couple of years, but each time, it builds on previous zoning efforts and
                concerns a smaller area.</p>

            <p><b><i>DEMOCRATIC?</i></b><br>Some stakeholders (e.g. Brazil nut harvesters) gained influence via the zoning process. But miners, industrial
                agriculturalists, and loggers were not even invited to the roundtable because conservationists thought their activities were not compatible
                with TNR goals.</p>

            <p><b><i>INEFFECTIVE?</i></b><br>Pluralistic processes like participatory land use zoning tend to favor ambiguous rules for zones (e.g. the
                Community Reserve zone). This ambiguity helps bring competing stakeholders together, but it makes subsequent enforcement difficult. Also,
                in this case (like many others), international donors funded the zoning exercise (~US$ 500k total) but did not provide funds for subsequent
                enforcement.</p>

        <h4><b>TAKEAWAY:</b></h4>
            <p><i>Participatory zoning</i> is an example of <b>community-engaged</b> conservation. It is <b>slow, politically fraught work, but it is key to
                enduring land stewardship</b>. Also remember, <b>local zoning efforts are inadequate to defend land from activities like mining</b>.
                Controlling a high-profit, highly destructive activity like mining requires <b>both community engagement and strong government support</b>.</p>
