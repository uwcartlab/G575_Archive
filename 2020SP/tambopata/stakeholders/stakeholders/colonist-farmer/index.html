          <p>Luisa Herrera and her family moved five years ago to the Tambopata National Reserve in search of new farm land and opportunities. They left Cuzco, a city
            in the Peruvian Andes, due to land scarcity and unemployment. Immigrants to the Amazon, like Luisa and her family, are often referred to as ‘colonists’.
            Like other colonists, upon her arrival, Luisa claimed 30

           of land along the highway. Every year, Luisa and her family plant rice and corn in fields
           cleared in the forest until the soil becomes ‘tired’ and less productive. Then, they convert the old field to cattle pasture and clear a new field in the
           forest. They eat most of the food they grow and sell the surplus if they have any.

          <p>Like other poor residents of Tambopata, Luisa is worried about her family’s financial future. She hopes someday to buy a truck and sell food in town or
            to local miners. Or, she might convert her whole farm into a pasture and get a job in the city. Some of her neighbors are talking about selling their land

            and then moving deeper into the forest to claim new farmland. But Luisa does not have legal title to her land and doesn’t think she’d
            be paid much for it. She is a member of the Agrarian Federation

                <b>Leader of the Agrarian Federation (FADEMAD)</b>
                <br>Alan leads FADEMAD, a grassroots political organization that represents
                 ~5000 small farmers in the Madre de Dios region. Alan believes that poor farmers’ quality of life
                 depends on a healthy environment. Thus, he tries to defend local farmers AND the forest. Click

            a local political organization, and has heard some members talk about transitioning from shifting agriculture to agroforestry. SHe might even be able to start
            growing organic cacao (the source of chocolate) and sell it via a local marketing coop that could negotiate a better price. Consumer demand for certified chocolate
            is on the rise. But Luisa has no knowledge or experience with tropical tree crops like cacao – she would need training to pursue agroforestry. She also wonders how he
            could survive financially while waiting the five years for the cacao trees to bear fruit. She could always turn to working for her friends in their illegal gold mining
            camp. Gold mining is back-breaking, often dangerous work, but if you’re lucky, you can make a lot of money in a short time.
          </p>

          </p>Luisa and most other FADEMAD members are poor, but they are the largest interest group in the region, and they have strength in numbers. Luisa and her fellow
            colonists keep pushing their leaders to take a firm pro-agriculture stand. They know they need financial, technical, and political support to be successful farmers
            in Tambopata.
