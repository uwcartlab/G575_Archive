          Maria strongly believes that local poor citizens should have priority to use natural resources
          in the Reserve, but they must do so sustainably. Her livelihood depends on access to the old growth
          forests that contain large Brazil nut trees. These trees take decades to start producing nuts and
          cannot be cultivated in plantations. The most productive trees are over a century old and more than
          ten stories high. By law, Brazil nut trees cannot be felled, but they are commonly cleared during
          agriculture or mining.

          Brazil nut harvesting is hard work. Brazil nut trees are dispersed across the forest. Thus,
          Maria must walk a wide area to gather the cannonball-like seed pods that fall from each Brazil nut
          tree. Even though it’s labor intensive, most environmentalists believe Brazil nut harvesting is one
          of the most sustainable ways for local poor people to make money off the forest. Brazil nut trees are also a

          Maria fears that mining and agriculture will destroy these forests and, ultimately, her family’s livelihood. But she’s also
          worried that she can’t make enough money only harvesting Brazil nuts, especially given the rudimentary infrastructure available
          for transporting and processing the nuts. Thus, Maria is exploring other options.

          who claim to be using methods that extract timber without damaging Brazil nut trees. Logging is currently not allowed in the Brazil nut
          in the Reserve, but some Brazil nut harvesters think it would be a good way to add value to the standing forest
          and help compete against mining or agriculture. Other Brazil nut harvesters suspect loggers will seriously damage
          the forest. Last, Maria has heard that some other Brazil nut harvesters have signed contracts with a
          Peruvian conservation company, <a href="http://www.bosques-amazonicos.com/en/our-projects/redd-in-concessions-of-brazil-nuts-in-madre-de-dios-peru"target="_blank"><i>Bosques Amazónicos</i></a>,
          to be paid for protecting forest and planting Brazil nut tree seedlings in their concessions. The company
          has also promised to build a Brazil nut processing plant. The payments come from a forest carbon fund
