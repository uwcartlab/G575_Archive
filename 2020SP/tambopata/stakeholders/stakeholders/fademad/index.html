                Madre de Dios: (literally “Mother of God”) the name of the 8.5 million ha Department (region)
                surrounding Tambopata. It is the least populated area in Peru (~ 1 person/km2).

             region. FADEMAD’s goal is to improve the quality of life of its members, both long-time residents and more-recently settled colonists.
          </p>

          <p>
            Alan believes that poor farmers’ quality of life depends on a healthy environment. Thus, he tries to defend local farmers AND the forest. He grew up
            in the Amazon, as did his father and grandfather. He’s proud of his farm. He’s planted a wide variety of crops together in a way that protects the soil,
            includes trees, and attracts wildlife. He thinks this form of agriculture (called agroforestry) is the best hope for protecting the environment while
            also providing local citizens food and income. As the leader of FADEMAD, he has worked closely with conservationists to help farmers learn about agroforestry.

          <p>
            He’s also intrigued by new opportunities for local poor farmers to earn extra income by selling certain crops–especially cacao–under a certification system.
            Growing cacao can be a lot of work for very little money, but if cacao could be sold under a certification scheme, this could create a sustainable source
            of income for Tambopata’s farmers.
