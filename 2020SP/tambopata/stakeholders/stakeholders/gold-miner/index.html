            Elena Gomez is a long-time resident of Tambopata and a gold miner who has been mining the banks of the Malinowski river for 20 years. Elena first turned
            to gold mining when her family was in an economic crisis and she desperately needed to make some cash fast. Like many of her mining friends, she calls himself
            an

            miner because she uses only modest equipment. She does not have a formal (legal) mining title or permit. Elena submitted the initial paperwork
            for a permit to Peru’s Ministry of Energy and Mines, but she can’t afford to pay for the environmental impact assessment a legal permit would require. 
            <br><br>
            As a result, Elena, like the vast majority of the miners she knows, works at the margins of the law. Since Elena has been operating illegally, the military has
            destroyed her mining equipment twice as part of their crackdown on illegal mining in the region. Now she must work for another miner who buys bigger equipment
            with the aid of crime syndicates. She is alarmed by increasing violence in mining areas and sees that other old-timer artisanal miners are arming themselves
            and taking turns at guard when they are at the riverbanks.

                <br>Miguel is the leader of the local Mining Federation and a gold miner. He is
                  thrilled that gold prices are rising. But he’s troubled that labor conditions for miners in Tambopata have gotten more dangerous in recent years. Click

            an organization that is fighting for the rights of miners. Mining has grown in Tambopata in recent years, and larger-scale miners have begun to push artisanal
            miners as well as farmers off their land with threats of violence. Given the rising global demand for gold, Elena thinks it is impossible to stop mining in
            Tambopata and that the government should focus on regulating the activity and helping local residents benefit from the activity instead of outsiders. Elena is
            disturbed by news reports that mining is contaminating the region’s water and fish, yet she is proud to be a miner. She just wishes she could work independently,
            with no fear of violence, and that she could afford to use lower polluting mining technology.
